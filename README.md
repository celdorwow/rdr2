# Introduction

This is a collected number of tips and clues that I believe may improve experience in the game.
It's dedicated to relatively new players.
Almost everything listed here can be done in early stage as soon as in chapter 2.
There is aslo a section with a few general tips.

The whole content is based on information I found in internet but some details are provided from my experience, as well.

I hope you find it post useful.


<a id="orgf498ea2"></a>

# Always save your progress

I start with this one.
Make sure that you have `Autosave` option turned on (search in `General` options).
This is extremely important because many things could go wrong that impacts the current state and you may lose hours of the progress.
For instance, I almost lost the $1000 worth Arabian I purchased, which fell down from a high cliff edge.
It was an accident but still she died.
I just started the game and had an additional saving.
Otherwise, I would lose my horse permanently.
Do save the game regularly if you plan to complete challenges.


<a id="orgf51f495"></a>

# Early progression

I did not realise how much can be done as soon as in Chapter 2.
Here's a list of things I believe will improve everyone's progress.
Some of them are borrowed from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqBDge3h46U), which I also recommend to watch.


<a id="org9eb5666"></a>

## Find gold bars

Apparently, there are 24 gold bars in the story mode, each of which can be sold to a fence for $500. 
After completing all treasure maps, players should have 15 gold bars.
Another 6 gold bars can be found in hidden places.
One gold bar is offered by a German family for helping to rescue a father/husband.
Another gold bar is also available after completing Chapter 3.
I didn't care to search for the last one.
If you do, see this website: [All Gold Bar Locations in Red Dead Redemption.](https://progameguides.com/red-dead-redemption/all-gold-bar-locations-in-red-dead-redemption-2/)


<a id="org5005eae"></a>

### Treasure maps

Here's the [link](https://www.ign.com/wikis/red-dead-redemption-2/Treasure_Maps#Red_Dead_Redemption_2_.28RDR2.29_Treasure_Maps) to a list of maps.
You should be able to complete every one of them very early: 

-   the Jack Hall Gang Treasure: 2 gold bars
-   the High Stakes Treasure: 3 gold bars
-   the Poisonous Trail Treasure: 4 gold bars
-   the Landmark of Riches Treasure Map: 6 gold bars.


<a id="orgab2ca60"></a>

### Hidden places

Below are names of other places with 6 additional gold bars.

****Town Limpany****

Search for the old town *Limpany* south of *Valentine* and west from *Dakota River* ([link](https://www.ign.com/wikis/red-dead-redemption-2/Limpany)).
A gold bar is hidden in small box in a sheriff office (the right building next to a prison).

****Old train wreck****

At the *Cottora Springs*, northern part of the map, search for an old wreck of a train car.

![img](https://github.com/celdorwow/rdr2-tips/blob/main/images/train_wreck.png "Location in Braithwaite Manor (credits to IGN)")

You can easily spot it from rail tracks on a bridge (the one before small tunnel).
It's quite hard to get there because you need to climb rocks and then make 2 jumps before you get to the wagon.
You will find 2 gold bars and Valerian Root.

****Mysterious Hill Home****

Not far from *Cottora Springs* is the *Window Rock*.
There's a painting on a wall of a big rock.
Make sure Arthur made a sketch of it.
Then, head to *Mysterious Hill Home*.
Once there, look at the opposite direction to rocks.
Between two trees you should see a path which leads to a small cave.
Inside you find 7 male statues surrounding the one in the middle with wings that looks like a harpy.
Here is [the link](https://www.ign.com/wikis/red-dead-redemption-2/The_Strange_Statue_Puzzle) to a website about how to solve the puzzle.


<a id="orgc65b567"></a>

### Extra gold bar after chapter 3

Later after chapter 3 is completed, there is an additional gold bar located in the *Braithwaite Manor*.
You can revisit the location to find one gold bar inside a locked box in the rubble of the building.
You can also loot Catherine Braithwaite's corpse to loot a porcelain brooch belonging to the late character

Here the map to this location:

![img](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/red-dead-redemption-2/a/a5/Red_Dead_Redemption_2_20181029151456.jpg?width=1024 "Location in Braithwaite Manor (credits to IGN)")


<a id="org7c6a0ea"></a>

## Tame Arabian

Find and tame the wild Arabian.
She wanders an area next to *Lake Isabella* located in *Grizzlies West*.
This one of the best horses available free.
You just need to make sure you bring her to a stable.
The horse also makes it much easier to complete Horseman challenges.

Apparently there's a glitch.
The horse can run away, run out of the map, might get shot or injured and eventually die even before you get her to a stable.
This may cause inability to spawn the horse again.
For this reason, save you current progress ****somewhere outside the Lake Isabella**** BEFORE you approach the Arabian.
*Ewing Basic* is far enough, although [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqBDge3h46U) suggests *Barrow Lagoon* to the east of *Lake Isabella*.


<a id="org3db246b"></a>

## Get following weapons for free


<a id="orgea72879"></a>

### Schofield Revolver

In *Valentine*, inspect a hidden activity at the rear of the doctor's shop.
After that, you will be able to rob him.
The Schofield Revolver is inside a box on the table. 


<a id="org14a082c"></a>

### Semi-Auto Shotgun

At *Watson's Cabin* in *Big Valley*, there is a small house.
You can collect a shotgun from a box in the basement.
There's also a female Hermit, who holds half of the treasure map leading to a unique weapon.


<a id="orgf3753d7"></a>

### Lancaster Repeater

Head to *Rhodes* and find a gunsmith shop.
On the right-hand side, inspect a basement window to find out that there's someone imprisoned there.
Get back to Gunsmith and rob him.
In the basement, you will find Lancaster Repeater.


<a id="org42ee212"></a>

### Double Action Revolver

In *Lemoyne*, head to *Lonnie's Shack* and kill whole family.
Find a box under one of the beds with a revolver in the bedroom.
This is also available as a task with Sean.
You may visit the house later and get the second revolver.


<a id="org7776a38"></a>

### Bolt Action Rifle

There are two ways to get this rifle as early as in chapter 2.

1.  First option. This require to start the mission: ****The First Shall Be Last**** in which you rescue Sean from bounty hunters.
    After killing first two guards by knife, follow quietly with Javier to spot two next guards.
    One of them will hold the rifle.
    Make sure you kill them before they can spot you.
    Then, one of them will drop the rifle.

2.  In *Valentine*, you may encounter a side event where Sheriff is about to hung a few convicts.
    He will hold the Bolt Action Rifle.
    Afterwards, when you see a woman crying, follow Sheriff and antagonise him in a semi safe spot, possibly between buildings.
    He will aim at you with the rifle.
    Once you have killed him (or knocked him), pick the rifle.


<a id="orgaeade00"></a>

### Rare Shotgun (Double Barrel Shotgun)

Go to the eastern side of the map, North from *Annesburg* and find *Manito Glade*, an old ruined cottage surrounded by a fence.
Approach the house and you will hear shouts and threats to be shot at from someone inside.
This is a male Hermit.
Kill him when he eventually come out and pick the shotgun.
He also holds the other half of a map leading to a unique weapon.


<a id="orgbb01e36"></a>

### Rolling Block Rifle

While, the free version of this gun is available later in Chapter 3 at the end of the mission [Magicians for Sport](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Magicians_for_Sport), you can still buy the gun from any Gunsmith after completing the mission [Pouring Forth Oil](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Pouring_Forth_Oil_I) (see this link [this link](https://holdtoreset.com/how-to-get-the-rare-rolling-block-rifle-in-red-dead-redemption-2/).)


<a id="orgd10d958"></a>

### Off-hand holster

Complete the first challenge of Master Hunter and go to any tapper.
Select ****Reinforced Equipment**** -> ****Master Hunter**** -> ****Master Hunter Off-Hand Holster****.
From now onward, you can use an off-hand revolvers and pistols.


<a id="org9100e04"></a>

## Get the Legend of the East satchel

Collecting requires items will take some time.
Once you have crafted all individual satchels, you eventual unlock the Legend of the East.

This is IMO one of the best quality-of-life improvement.
When you get it, everything will stack up to 99, including plants, meats, alcohols, tonics, canned food, etc.
Tonics and alcohol have the regular and opened variants, which are stored separately.
Note this does not apply to ammunition, which has separate in-game challenges to complete, e.g. Weapon Master.
I recommend buying only required number of tonics because they are expensive and can still be looted from bodies&#x2013;bounty hunters are a good source.

You can slightly speed up the process of collecting perfect pelts if you get the legendary Buck Antler trinket (see [next section](#orga4624c9)).

<a id="orga4624c9"></a>


<a id="orgc095e2f"></a>

## Get trinkets: Buck Antler and Elk Antler


<a id="orgc319733"></a>

### Buck Antler Trinket

This is particularly useful trinket.
Once you have crafted it, you increase a chance to get good and best quality pelts.
This is important if you plan to craft items available from Pearson or tappers.

The Legendary Buck is located at North West of *Strawberry*, the northern part of *West Elizabeth*.
You should bring Bolt Action Rifle or Rolling Block Rifle and equip it with Express Ammo because legendaries take slightly more damage to kill.

It's more convenient in Chapter 2 because the van der Linde gang is located near *Valentine*, which is closer to Strawberry, in oppose to Rhodes later in Chapter 3.


<a id="org457a43f"></a>

### Elk Antler Trinket

This is also a handful trinket, especially in the early progression.
It increases the value of looted money by 10 %.


<a id="orge3651a9"></a>

## Use Valerian Root tonic

Unless you are super shooter, you will likely depend on Dead Eye for the entire game.
The Valerian Root tonics greatly improve Dead Eye experience.
Two locations I know of are:

-   *Limpany* town (search for it if you are searching for a gold bar)
-   Old car wreck (see how to find hidden gold bars)


<a id="org95dac28"></a>

## Get Miner Hat and Wide-Blade Knife

It's an another handful improvement.
When you wander inside caves, Arthur can only hold a revolver or a pistol because the other hand is occupied to use a lamp.
Thanks to this hat, it is possible to use all the weapons.

****Directions****

Head to *Big Valley* and find *Beryl's Dream* trail and find a mine.
When you are inside, follow downhill to a pile of rocks.
The way inside is blocked.
You should see a wire leading to the entrance.
Back at the entrance, you will find a detonator to the right.
Blow up the rocks and unblock the way.
Once you have got inside, follow the path to the right where you should see a dead body.
Take the Wide-Blade Knife and pick the Miner Hat next to the body.


<a id="orge9d57a9"></a>

## The Pearson's Scout Jacket

I am merely point at the possibility to obtain this rare jacket.
I didn't get it but perhaps you can :)

This is one of the minor mission and is extremely rare.
Once the mission is successfully triggered, Pearson will request a rabbit to make a special soup for Arthur.
This will also unlock the Pearson's unique Scout Jacket for Arthur.

There seem to be certain requirements for this mission to get started, for instance

-   Be in Chapter 2 - not sure about that but it seems to be most successful
-   Be at camp in the morning, before soup is served
-   Pearson must be
    -   standing next to crate with bear
    -   drinking a beer and
    -   whistling.

Then, after approaching to Pearson, the only option available to interact with him should be "Greet".
Then, Pearson should respond "you look peaky".
On interaction Pearson should request an item: a rabbit for his special soup.
After completing this mission, Arthur should receive a very rare and unique Scout Jacket.

# A few tips


<a id="org9b587b3"></a>

## Horse Revivers

Keep a few Horse Revivers with you in case your horse has got injured.
Remember, if your horse die, you will lose him/her permanently.
Make sure you also save the game regularly.


<a id="org7ef5785"></a>

## Increase capacity for ammunition

Partial upgrades are available at Gunsmith.
The other upgrades can only be obtained in a tapper after completing challenges.
I think completing one full set of 10 challenges should get you upgraded.
I find Bandit, Weapon Expert, and Horseman challenges the easiest to complete.
The [Bandit](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Bandit_Challenges), while quite entertaining, will most likely get you a Wanted level on many occasions.
Get prepared to either pay bounties or have hunters on your head unless you don't care :p
As a side note, bounty hunters are a good source of some useful items, such as Chewing Tabacco, tonics, etc. 
Horseman is OK but Rank 9 requires to ride a horse from Van Horn to Blackwater in less than 17 minutes, which is difficult because the area around Blackwater spawns hunters with heavy fire.
You'd have to bring tonics for you and your horse or you will likely fail.
You could try to use [this glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOjaUmTskqs) but it didn't work for me.
I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBODf1cqHK0&t=427s) of a guy who did it without any glitch.
The author chose an excellent route to make it doable within less than 13 minutes.

<a id="orgcce1835"></a>

## Train robbery

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UANnDH1oh0&t=133s) to see a train robbery in action without getting bounty.
I am linking it because I also found a set of useful clues in the comment section.
I am afraid I have to quote them without credits because I forgot a name of a person who post the comment.
Anyway below are the tips (s)he gave :)

-   How to rob a train
    -   Get the miner's helmet from [*Beryl's Dream*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Beryl%27s_Dream) mine in *Big Valley*, *West Elizabeth*.
        Put it on before you pay for your ticket to *Annesburg*.
        It helps you see in the dark during the gun battle in the tunnel.
    -   [me] Make sure you equip all necessary weapons; they seem to disappear after travelling.
    -   After the train departs *Annesburg* station, you can leave your seat and climb up on top of the carriage and train surf until it's time to make your way forward to the locomotive.
        Stay crouched to avoid being knocked off when you pass through the various small tunnels before the big one.
        No-one will mind you being up there provided you DO NOT go on the forward two carriages.
    -   Stay on the third coach leaving yourself a run up.
        When you catch sight of the tunnel, stand up and run forward, leaping from carriage to carriage all the way to the locomotive.
        Time it right and you will be on the footplate just as you enter the tunnel.
        This minimises the time the guards are alerted.
    -   Don't bother drawing your gun and shooting the driver.
        Instead select the "Drive Train" prompt when it appears.
        You will automatically throw the engineer off the moving train as you assume control of the engine.
    -   Press accelerate and continue into the tunnel.
    -   Instead of stopping the train, just leave the controls. The train will free wheel to a halt.  But while it's moving it prevents guards jumping off the train and running along the track to flank you.  That allows you to target all of them inside of the train, which keeps them in one direction and allows you to control the battle.
    -   Rob the train as normal and escape.

It's important you apply a bandanna as well swap outfit.
It turns out other travellers might sometimes recognise Arthur after one of the previous robberies, although that never happened to me. 


<a id="org9492a7c"></a>

## Talismans and Trinkets

Talismans are very easy to obtain.
You just need to kill legendary animals to get required items and craft talismans at any fence.

Trinkets on the other hand involve a little work and require multiple items including those from legendary animals.
Eventually, you will have to collect the following items:

-   Old Brass Compass
-   Vintage Civil War Handcuffs
-   Gold Jointed Bracelet
-   Silver Chain Bracelet
-   Silver Earring
-   Gold Earring.

Both Old Brass compass and Vintage Civil War Handcuffs are rewards from side missions from strangers.
The first item requires completion of the [*Geology for Beginners*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Geology_for_Beginners).
Players have to send the full list of locations of some drawings on certain rocks to Francis Sinclair.
After an in-game day or so, an invitation is sent back via mail.
It doesn't happen at once so do not search for any glitch.
After visiting his house, the compass is on the table.
Make sure you do collect the watch because it turns out people were not able to enter the house again if they came back later after some time.

The other item is given after sending any full set of cigarette cards.
While any will do, I would suggest [Fauna of America Card](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Fauna_of_America_Card_Set) as an example because it does not involve visiting areas such as *Blackwater*.

The easiest way to obtain remaining items like special jewellery is to rob trains.
It is possible to do that without a bounty, however Arthur still gets massive low honour after each robbery.
You have to buy a ticket to *Annesburg* and from there continue until the train leaves the town (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UANnDH1oh0&t=133s) and my collected clues in the [previous section](#orga553a89)).
Note you might need to rob more than one train to get required items.
As a side note, you may simultaneously do the Rank 10 of the [Bandit challenges](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Bandit_Challenges), which requires 5 train robberies.


<a id="org76d2e42"></a>

## Hunting perfect pelts from cougars and panthers

It might be hard to get perfect pelts from predators at first.
However, if you get used to the Dead Eye and get prepared, this task becomes much easier accomplish.
"Be prepared" means you have brought tonics, food, weapons and have all cores already restored.

Sometimes, predators can be spotted and killed if they are already occupied.
Other times, you may see a red dot of a predator approaching you and have enough time to react.
However, in majority situations, you will just get attacked.

In order to obtain the perfect pelt, shoot when a predator is close to you.
For instance, if you spot it first, let it get closer so it is clear where to aim for a headshot. 
If it's found you first, you have to survive the first attack.
Then do not bother restoring your health, just aim at head when it turns back at you and shoot using the Dead Eye.
Also, all the time keep your weapon loaded so there's no delay when you quickly need to shoot.

Personally, I found Bolt Action Rifle the best weapon for this task, without scope and equipped with Express Ammo.
You could bring an alternative rifle equipped with a long scope, e.g. Rolling Block Rifle, in case you want to kill a predator from a distance.
However, I don't recommend it because it's easy to miss the perfect shot. 
A bow with Improved Arrows is also a good weapon.


<a id="org0abcaa9"></a>

## Fishing

In general, the basics of fishing are simple.
Find water and, when you are close enough, select the fishing pole and apply a bait.
General baits such as cheese or bread will work for small fishes.
Catching any medium or large ones requires proper a bait depending on the place, such as a river, lake or swamp.
You can buy regular baits in general stores.
However, you will eventually need to go to *Lagras* to find a seller who specialises in fishing and buy proper baits there.

Fishing for a large fish is slightly tricky, especially if you want to complete the Survivalist challenge Rank 9&#x2013;you have to catch at least a 19-pound fish.
Once it's get hooked, it will make splashes which means the fish is trying to escape.
Tire your fishing pole from side to side against directions it moves.
Then, use the reel when it's tired (lack of splashing).
Large ones will likely pull out the line but the game will suggest how to prevent it.
Also, a large fish can snap much easily and when it's about to happen your screen starts shaking.
Make sure to stop pulling fishing pole and applying any pressure.
Then continue as usual.


<a id="orgde82c57"></a>

## Honour

Sometimes, you must do things which lower your honour but you can easily restore it by doing following activities:

-   Go for fishing and throw away every fish you catch
-   Go to Saint Denis and keep greeting everyone you see.

I believe the rate with fishing is much better than that of greeting everyone in Saint Denis.

Some other random events:

-   Rescue victims from their oppressors
-   Help random strangers whenever you can&#x2013;they also lead to extra money.

Later in the game let borrowers keep debts and you greatly improve Arthur's honour.


<a id="orga20f6cf"></a>

## Other general tips

-   Finish challenges!
    Each completed set slightly improves one of your cores and unlocks skins for holsters, bandoliers and belts.
    Any completed set also upgrades the ammo capacity. 
    Apart from improvements and upgrades, you also learn a lot about the game and become much more effective in many ways.
-   If you or your horse stack somewhere, there's no way back and you might lose him, setting a camp will bring you both to a safe place.
-   It's good to reach max level bonding between you and your horse before attempting any Horseman challenges. Some of them require to travel from one place to another in a limited time.
    You will have to keep your horse at max speed, which greatly burns his stamina. 
    However, if you pet your horse every now and again, not too often, you can restore some of the stamina proportionally to a bonding level.
    With a good horse and saddle, you can even manage to complete challenges without using any tonic!
-   Never pick up worn weapons.
    Once you do so, it is then transported to your horse and will be there forever when you cycle through available weapons.
    It's one of the annoyances R\* has never bothered to sort out.
-   Use train tracks to shorten routes.
    This is particularly important for Horseman challenges.
-   Priorities white mission over yellow because they may be time-sensitive and get wiped by the narrative.
    Yellow missions are milestones and will be always waiting for you.
-   When doing any kind of robbery, always wear a bandanna!
    It also helps if you change clothes.
    I interchange two outfits for all robberies.
-   Save tonics for hard tasks and use Chewing Gum/Tabacco and Moonshine everywhere else.
    The latter are cheap and effective but run off too quickly during more demanding tasks.
-   Each time you leave a town, your weapons remain in holsters.
    Make sure you take them out and be ready for any ambush or an attack by predators etc.
-   Help strangers. They eventually lead to extra cash.
    For instance
    -   rescued prisoners give clues about possible homesteads with hidden stashes
    -   wounded strangers will eventually recognise you at towns and let you buy stuff for free as a sign of gratitude. It is your choice what items you buy, so choose something expensive, s.a. outfits or weapons.
-   If you loot for valuables items and want to keep honour high, kill O'Driscoll gangs at their hideouts or small camps.
    Two main hideout locations are *Six Point Cabin* and *Hanging Dog Ranch* (see [this link](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/O%27Driscoll_Boys) for more possible locations).
    Fully cleared hideouts repopulate after ~3 in-game days.
    Leaving one gang member alive before leaving the area resets the hideout meaning you don't have to wait.
    However, it may take a challenge to loot dead bodies under the fire :p
-   Do me a favour and antagonise Micah whenever you can.


<a id="orgb6490c7"></a>

# End game and things to do before the end of Chapter 6 (Spoilers)

Be careful to proceed if you are going through the story mode for the first time and are still in one of the early chapters.
I think you will be safe to come back when you approach one of the final mission in Chapter 6: [*My Last Boy*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/My_Last_Boy).

<details>
<summary><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">!!! Spoilers start here !!!</span></summary>

<br />

[*My Last Boy*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/My_Last_Boy) is the last mission after which players can control Arthur in the word.
The following two mission, that is [*Our Best Selves*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Our_Best_Selves) followed by [*Red Dead Redemption*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_(mission)) are final.
However once triggered, players are put in scenarios intervened with cutscenes and there is no possibility to go and do things in the open world.
Make sure everything is completed before you begin.

If you did the story before, you already know players lose certain things mainly horses, golds bars, tonics and cash.
However, you can save and pass cash to John.
This requires a trick with Aberdeen Pig Farm (see [How to pass cash to John](#org2e4ad09)).
If you plan to do so, do not spend too much on things you cannot sell.
Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/ubf5ml/what_carries_over_from_arthur_to_john_in_the/) that explain what gets passed to John.


## Cash and valuable items

Make sure you go to a fence and sell everything valuable s.a. gold bars before the last two missions are triggered (the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/ubf5ml/what_carries_over_from_arthur_to_john_in_the/)).
Then save money for the upcoming Epilogue (see [the last spoiler](#org2e4ad09)).
If you have triggered the mission, just leave the game and come back so the progress is not saved because `Save Game` option is locked during missions.


## Horses

Yes, you lose all horses and the one you ride on during the last mission gets killed.
Since it's possible to pass cash to John (see [the last spoiler](#org2e4ad09)), you may consider selling expensive horses to either a stabler or Clive Davies, whoever gives higher price.
If I am not mistaken, Clive would pay more for wild horses, such as white Arabian.
It turns out you cannot sell the first horse we get in Chapter 2.
Hence, he is ideal to sacrifice in the last mission.


## Satchels

Let Pearson craft all the extra satchels.
In Epilogue, the satchels will only be available at fence.


## Four variants of the end of Chapter 6

Save the game before [*Our Best Selves*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Our_Best_Selves).
This will let you experience four variants of the end of the Chapter 6.
Which variant is triggered depends on Arthur's honour and decision where he want to head with John when they are chased by Dutch, Micah and Pinkerton agents.
Arthur will have to decide between staying with John or chasing the money.
The former decision is the last chance for players to rise Arthur's honour.
The boost is significant and can be decisive.
In both cases Arthur eventually dies trying to achieve whatever goal he has decided on.

## How to pass Arthur's cash to John

It's possible to pass cash to John after Arthur dies.
Here's [the link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedeVtails/?id=2088821625) with steps.
However, I'd still quote the author here for convenience:

> Make sure you finished Arthur's second to last mission: [*My last Boy*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/My_Last_Boy) (the death of [Eagle Flies](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_Flies)).
> Go to the Aberdeen Pig Farm as Arthur, and pay a visit to the not at all creepy incestuous siblings.
> Accept the drink (or the food sample if it's your second visit) and find yourself in a mud pit with zero money.
> Return to the house and kill them both. (This is not required, but you know you want to.)
> The money is stored behind the *mom* painting directly at the front door.
> ****DON'T RETRIEVE IT****, but leave it for John to pick up later.
> Then start the mission: [*Our Best Selves*](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Our_Best_Selves) at Beaver Hollow.
> So then you're robbing a train, drama happens, Arthur dies and John drives his wagon to Pronghorn Ranch.
> After all that, return to the Aberdeen Pig Farm as John, and retrieve the money from behind the painting.
